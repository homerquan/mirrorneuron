Two things we are working on for MVP+
Improve the widget, console to make it a product useful to personal/education customers: anyone can register account and start up use it on their own websites. This will go as expected (ready in the Middle of Feb)
Our killer features: mimic learning on language and actions on will ONLY work on our website for a while.  Those features need more resources to be release for general user.

Note: Lots of those codes need to use python and other open sourced codes (namely NLP and probabilistic model) engineering it as other products will slow us down.  

We should keep in mind that customers may not expect to have those fancy features before we get investment and build meaningful engineering team. Itâ€™s more about showing what the capacity to investors and partners. 

(in summary, we will push on two frontlines: 1. sell a high quality product to win customers 2. show a fancy one to get investment, they will use different engineering standards. We can be flexible to tell the story but be cautious on difference.)
